# Smart Workout Tracker Repository

This repository hosts the Smart Workout Tracker, a web application designed to help users track their workouts efficiently. The application can be added directly to your iPhone's home screen, providing a seamless, app-like experience without the need for the Safari browser interface.

## Features

- **App-like Experience**: When added to the home screen, it launches in full-screen mode, eliminating Safari's address bar and navigation.
- **Easy Access**: Provides a dedicated icon on your home screen for quick and easy access.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Workout Tracker, you can clone this repository and follow the setup instructions below. This guide will also explain how to add the web application to your iPhone's home screen for an enhanced user experience.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Safari installed on your iPhone as this feature is specific to Safari.

### Instructions:

1. **Launch Safari and Visit Your App's URL:**
   - Open the Safari browser on your iPhone.
   - Navigate to the URL (e.g., `https://adamwenn.github.io/gym/`).

2. **Tap the Share Button:**
   - Once the app has loaded, look for the Share button at the bottom of your Safari screen. It looks like a square with an arrow pointing upwards.

3. **Find "Add to Home Screen":**
   - A menu will slide up from the bottom of your screen. Scroll down through the options until you see "Add to Home Screen." It has a small plus sign icon.

4. **Name Your Shortcut (Optional):**
   - A new screen will appear, showing the app's icon and a default name (likely "Smart Workout Tracker"). You can tap the name to change it to something shorter or more personal, like "My Workouts" or "Gym Tracker."

5. **Tap "Add":**
   - Once you're satisfied with the name, tap the "Add" button in the top-right corner of the screen.

### You're Done!

The Smart Workout Tracker icon will now appear on your iPhone's home screen. Tap it to launch your workout tracker in a full-screen, browser-less mode, just like a native app!
